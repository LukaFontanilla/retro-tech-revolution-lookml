# Retro Tech Revolution: LookML Data Dictionary

## Overview

This LookML project provides a semantic layer for analyzing data from the "Retro Tech Revolution" game. It defines the dimensions and measures available for exploring game session data, player activity, and AI assistant (Gemini) usage. This README.md provides a high-level overview of the LookML structure, key views, and custom visualizations.

## Views

The LookML project is organized into several views, each representing a table or derived table in the underlying database.

* **events:** Captures individual game events, such as player actions, enemy interactions, and system events.  Key fields include `event_time`, `event_type`, `client_id`, `session_id`, `player_health`, `player_points`, enemy details, bullet type, difficulty changes, prompts, reasons, scores, and timestamps.  It also categorizes events and extracts screen names and Gemini interaction types.
* **sessions:** Aggregates data at the game session level.  It is derived table that calculates session metrics like `session_start`, `session_end`, `session_duration_minutes`, `max_score`, `enemies_defeated`, `player_deaths`, Gemini interactions, and progression (`reached_level1`, `reached_boss1`).  It also calculates skill and engagement tiers.
* **latest_sessions**: (Presumed) Likely provides a view of the most recent game sessions, potentially for real-time or near real-time analysis.
* **screenshots**: (Presumed) Likely provides access to in-game screenshots captured during gameplay.  The `event_id` in the `events` view might be used to join with this view.
* **v_ranking**: (Presumed) This view probably holds ranking information, possibly derived from player scores or other performance metrics.
* **game_play_summaries**: (Presumed) Contains summarized data related to game play, potentially aggregating information from the `events` and `sessions` views.
* **gemini_summary**: (Presumed) Provides a summary of Gemini AI usage, possibly including metrics on help requests and backstory interactions.

## Explores

* **sessions:** This is the primary explore in the project, allowing users to analyze game sessions. It joins the `sessions` view, enabling analysis of session-level metrics.  Users can explore how player behavior and progression vary across sessions.  Key dimensions and measures from the `sessions` view are exposed for analysis.

## Custom Visualizations

The project includes custom JavaScript visualizations to enhance data exploration:

* **rankingViz.js:** Implements a custom leaderboard visualization. This visualization is used to display player rankings based on performance metrics (e.g., score, time).
* **Markdown Visualization:** (bundle.js) Enables the use of Markdown within Looker dashboards and reports. This allows for richer text formatting, embedding images, and creating more informative content.  (Note: bundle.js suggests this is a packaged visualization, potentially containing more than just Markdown support).

## End Report and Capabilities

The end report provides a comprehensive view of player behavior and game session data.  Key capabilities include:

* **Player Progression Analysis:** Track how players advance through the game (e.g., reaching levels, defeating bosses).
* **Session Analysis**: Analyze session duration, player scores, and other session-level metrics.
* **AI Assistant (Gemini) Usage:** Measure how players interact with the in-game AI assistant.
* **Player Behavior:** Analyze player actions, such as movement, damage taken, and combat performance.
* **Custom Leaderboards:** Visualize player rankings using the custom `rankingViz.js` visualization.
* **Rich Reporting:** Use Markdown visualization to create more informative and visually appealing reports.
* **Real-time Insights:** (Inferred) The `latest_sessions` view suggests the possibility of real-time or near real-time insights into current player activity.

## Analytics Pipeline Architecture

The analytics pipeline architecture can be described as follows:

1.  **Game Data Source:** Game event data is generated by the "Retro Tech Revolution" game.  (The specific source is not detailed, but could be game logs, database, etc.).
2.  **Data Ingestion:** Game event data is ingested into a data warehouse (`retro_tech_revolution.v_all_events`).
3.  **Data Transformation:** The `sessions` view uses a derived table to aggregate data from the `events` table, calculating session-level metrics.  Other views likely perform additional transformations or aggregations.
4.  **LookML Modeling:** LookML is used to define the semantic layer on top of the transformed data, creating views and explores.
5.  **Data Exploration:** Looker users can explore the data using the defined explores and visualizations, including custom visualizations.
6.  **Reporting and Dashboards:** Looker reports and dashboards provide insights into player behavior, game progression, and other key metrics.
